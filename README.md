Mental Health plays a prominent a role in our present day daily routine. There are many factors which influence the mental health of an individual. In the project here we accessed the data from CDC(Center for Disease Control), to extract the features of medical data, physiological data, data regarding individualâ€™s lifestyle, and the prescription medication used by the individual. 
The aim is to find the mental state of an individual, from a questionnaire data, which is formed by taking the required features from the extracted data. The data contains many features including medical conditions of the individuals, demographic data, lifestyle factors and the prescription data. 
We have also build an application prototype using streamlit to take inputs for the questionnaire and process the data through the ML models to output the predicted mental state of the individual. It also presents the data of the individuals with similar mental states.

The above model can be used by any individual, and re evaluate their perception of their own mental health. They might change their thoughts about any consultations.
